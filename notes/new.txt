These are my algebra notes.

Theorem: a subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

Proof: let G be a cyclic group generated by a, so G = <a>. Then let a^n be in H for some n \in Z^+.

blah blah blah, but by using the vision algorithm we have that 

n = mq + r for r within 0 and m

Please insert a cool integral used in complex analysis

GENERATE TIKZ picture of a sphere with a dotted background and a vector from the center of the sphere with an angle alpha

GENERATE TIKZ of a solid blue star within a rectangle of size R by Q. Label the rectangle dimensions by R and Q.
