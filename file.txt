laplacian of gamma hat squared = lambda * partial derivitive wrt t of gamma 

now consider a topological space (X, tau) where tau is the discrete topology tau_discrete. this is some thing that has some words here and there are some words that are like lorem ipsum i just want to fill up the page with nonsense temporary text that i can type here asd asd asd asd asd asd and some math like the square root of pi is equal to the integral from -inf to inf of the gaussian function (in full form).

theorem: tau_discrete has n elements and |G| is <a>

proof: the proof is quite simple actually

definition
a topology is a set tau and set X so that the following axioms hold:
O1: closed
O2: null set in X

example
the trivial topology is just the set tau = {null set, X}
